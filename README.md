# Procedurally Animated Inverse Kinematics in Vanilla Minecraft
This uses a data pack. It's recommended to use this in a superflat world as the feet positions are hardcoded to -60 Y.

Hold a brush for it to follow you, and hold a breeze_rod to change its head position.

This uses the FABRIK (Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics) algorithm combined with distance constraints for realtime movement.
