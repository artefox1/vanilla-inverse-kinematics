# Procedurally Animated Inverse Kinematics in Vanilla Minecraft
This uses a data pack. It's recommended to use this in a superflat world as the feet positions are hardcoded to -60 Y. This can obviously be changed.

Hold a Brush to get chased, and hold a Breeze Rod to change its head position.

This uses the FABRIK (Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics) algorithm combined with distance constraints for realtime movement.

vibing is not included in the data pack.
