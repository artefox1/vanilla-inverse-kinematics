# Procedurally Animated Inverse Kinematics in Vanilla Minecraft
This uses a data pack. It's recommended to use this in a superflat world as the feet positions are hardcoded to -60 Y. This can obviously be changed.

Hold a Brush to get chased, and hold a Breeze Rod to change its head position.

This uses the FABRIK (Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics) algorithm combined with distance constraints for realtime movement.
